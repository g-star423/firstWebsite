# firstWebsite

## This will be my first solo-designed website, which is the Unit 1 project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.

### We are required to use JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

My website uses HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript.

The bulk of the technical work went into the Stock Portfolio page of the website, where I learned how to call an API multiple times, and how to interact with JS Promises. I quickly learned that milliseconds matter with API calls.

Before I started the Stock Portfolio page, I made the smaller page that uses the Datamuse API, which is where I practiced making API Calls for the first time.

The other bulk of my time with the site was spend learning as much nuance with CSS and mobile design. It took many many hours to get the website looking anywhere near what I wanted it to. Just learning to make a mobile menu was a challenge, and I am still not satisfied with the finished result.
